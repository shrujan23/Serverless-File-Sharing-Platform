# Serverless-File-Sharing-Platform
### Project Description:
* The Serverless File Sharing Platform is a cloud-native application that allows users to upload and share files securely through a web browser or HTTP client. Built using AWS Lambda, API Gateway, and Amazon S3, the platform eliminates the need for traditional server management. It features a clean, browser-based frontend that provides drag-and-drop file uploads and automatic generation of secure, time-limited download links. With optional features like file expiry, user authentication, and usage tracking, itâ€™s ideal for developers, businesses, and individuals seeking a lightweight and scalable alternative to file transfer tools.
Use Cases:
 * Goal: Allow users to upload files, generate a unique download link, and share that link with others.
* Key Features:
  * Upload file (max size limit)
  * Generate unique download link
  * Download file using that link
  * Auto-delete files after expiration (optional)
